Description: Group SLOPE is a penalized linear regression method that is used
    for adaptive selection of groups of significant predictors in a
    high-dimensional linear model. 
    The Group SLOPE method can control the (group) false discovery rate at a
    user-specified level (i.e., control the expected proportion of irrelevant
    groups among the total number of groups of predictors selected by method).
