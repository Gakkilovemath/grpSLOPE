\title{Regularizing sequence for Group SLOPE}
\usage{
lambdaGroupSLOPE(fdr = 0.1, n.group = NULL, group = NULL, A = NULL,
  wt = NULL, n.subj = NULL, method = "gaussian", n.MC = n.group,
  MC.reps = 5000)
}
\arguments{
\item{fdr}{Target false discovery rate}

\item{group}{A vector describing the grouping structure. It should 
contain a group id for each predictor variable.}

\item{A}{The model matrix}

\item{wt}{A vector of weights}

\item{n.subj}{Number of rows in A (i.e. number of subjects)}

\item{method}{Possible values are "BH", "gaussian", "gaussianMC",
"basic", "mean",  "chi", "chi_mean", "chiMC". See details.}

\item{n.MC}{The corrections of the entries of lambda will be 
computed up to the index given by \code{n.MC} only. \code{n.MC} should be
less than or equal to \code{n.group}.}

\item{MC.reps}{The number of repetitions of the Monte Carlo procedure}

\item{n.groups}{Number of groups}
}
\description{
Generate the regularizing sequence \code{lambda} for the Group SLOPE
problem according to one of multiple methods.
}
\details{
Multiple methods are available to generate the regularizing sequence \code{lambda}.
"BH" denotes the method of Theorem 1.1 in Bogdan et. al. (2015),
"gaussian" denotes the method of Section 3.2.2 in Bogdan et. al. (2015),
"gaussianMC" denotes the method introduced in Gossmann et. al. (2015),
"basic" denotes the lambdas of Theorem 2.5 in Brzyski et. al. (2015),
"mean" uses the lambdas of equation (2.14) in Brzyski et. al. (2015),
"chi" uses Procedure 1 in Brzyski et. al. (2015),
"chi_mean" uses Procedure 2 in Brzyski et. al. (2015),
"chiMC" denotes a Monte Carlo lambda selection method based on equation 2.25
in Brzyski et. al. (2015).
