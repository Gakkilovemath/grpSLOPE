# Group SLOPE

## Code style

Variable names are all lower case with words separated by dots.
Function names begin with a lower case letter and are written in camel case.
Constants are named in camel case with an initial `k`.

Otherwise, I try to follow [Google's R style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml#identifiers).
