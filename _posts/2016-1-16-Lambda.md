title: Regularizing sequences for Group SLOPE
---

Currently the package `grpSLOPE` offers the function `lambdaGroupSLOPE` to generate the regularizing sequence $\lambda\subscript{1}, \ldots, \lambda\subscript{J}$ according to one of the following methods (specified via the function argument `method`):

* "BH" &mdash; method of Theorem 1.1 in Bogdan et. al. (2015) *SLOPE &mdash; Adaptive variable selection via convex optimization*.
* "gaussian" &mdash; method of Section 3.2.2 in Bogdan et. al. (2015) *SLOPE &mdash; Adaptive variable selection via convex optimization*.
* "gaussianMC" &mdash; method introduced in [Gossmann et. al. (2015) *Identification of Significant Genetic Variants via SLOPE, and Its Extension to Group SLOPE*](http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2808719.2808743).
* "chiOrthoMax" &mdash; method of Theorem 2.5 in [Brzyski et. al. (2015) *Group SLOPE — adaptive selection of groups of predictors*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09078).
* "chiOrthoMean" &mdash; $\lambda$s of equation (2.14) in [Brzyski et. al. (2015) *Group SLOPE — adaptive selection of groups of predictors*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09078).
* "chiEqual" &mdash; Procedure 1 in [Brzyski et. al. (2015) *Group SLOPE — adaptive selection of groups of predictors*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09078).
* "chiMean" &mdash; Procedure 2 in [Brzyski et. al. (2015) *Group SLOPE — adaptive selection of groups of predictors*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09078).
*  __Not yet implemented.__ ("chiMC" &mdash; a Monte Carlo method based on equation (2.25) [Brzyski et. al. (2015) *Group SLOPE — adaptive selection of groups of predictors*](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.09078)).

For illustration purposes we compute these regularizing sequences for simulated data consisting of 700 observations with 90 groups of predictors (30 groups of size 5, 30 groups of size 10, and 30 groups of size 20). Since the method "gaussianMC" requires the model matrix $A$, we simulated $A$ from the multivariate normal distribution, such that the mean pairwise correlation of predictors from the same group is 0.9498834 (variance: 1.631723e-05), and the average pairwise correlation of variables from different groups is 0.05981604 (variance: 0.007266408).

The following code demonstrates how the regularizing sequence can be computed with each of the above methods. The resulting sequences are graphed below.

```R
fdr     <- 0.1
n.obs   <- 700
n.group <- 90
group   <- vector()
for (i in 1:30) {
  tmp <- rep((i-1)*3+c(1,2,3), c(5,10,20))
  group <- c(group, tmp)
}
wt <- rep(c(sqrt(5), sqrt(10), sqrt(20)), 30)
names(wt) <- names(getGroupID(group))

lambda.BH <- lambdaGroupSLOPE(fdr=fdr, n.group=n.group, method="BH")
lambda.G <- lambdaGroupSLOPE(fdr=fdr, n.group=n.group, n.obs=n.obs,
                             method="gaussian")
lambda.MC <- lambdaGroupSLOPE(fdr=fdr, group=group, A=A, n.MC=30, 
                              MC.reps=5000, method="gaussianMC")
lambda.max <- lambdaGroupSLOPE(fdr=fdr, group=group, wt=wt, 
                               method="chiOrthoMax") 
lambda.mean <- lambdaGroupSLOPE(fdr=fdr, group=group, wt=wt, 
                                method="chiOrthoMean") 
lambda.chi <- lambdaGroupSLOPE(fdr=fdr, n.obs=n.obs, group=group, 
                               wt=wt, method="chiMean")
```
